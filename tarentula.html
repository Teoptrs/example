        <section class="p11"><h2>the chilean rose tarentula</h2><p>The Chilean rose tarantula (Grammostola rosea), also known as the Chilean fire tarantula, is a popular species among tarantula enthusiasts due to its hardy nature and relatively docile temperament. Native to the arid regions of Chile, Bolivia, and Argentina, these spiders are known for their attractive appearance, with reddish or pinkish hues on their thick bodies and legs. Growing to a leg span of around 12-15 centimeters, Chilean tarantulas are medium-sized and fairly easy to care for, making them an ideal choice for both beginner and experienced arachnid keepers.</p></section>
        <section class="p11"><h2 id="habitat">their habitat</h2><p>Chilean tarantulas thrive in relatively simple enclosures. A 20-30 liter terrarium is suitable, as these tarantulas are not highly active and do not require much space to roam. The enclosure should have good ventilation and a secure lid to prevent escape. As they come from dry environments, their terrarium should maintain low humidity levels of around 50-60%, with a temperature range between 21-27Â°C. Heating is generally not necessary unless room temperatures drop too low. A substrate of 5-10 centimeters of coconut fiber or soil is ideal for burrowing. The terrarium should also provide hiding spots like small caves or pieces of bark for the tarantula to retreat to and a shallow water dish to maintain hydration.</p></section>
        <section class="p11"><h2 id="behavior">behavior</h2><p>Chilean rose tarantulas are known for their calm and relatively passive behavior compared to other tarantula species. They are slow-moving and spend much of their time resting or burrowing. While they can be handled, it's important to remember that, like all tarantulas, they can become stressed if handled too frequently. When threatened, they may kick urticating hairs from their abdomen, which can cause irritation if they come into contact with human skin or eyes. However, they rarely display aggression and are more likely to retreat or remain still when disturbed. Their behavior makes them a good fit for those new to keeping tarantulas.</p></section>
