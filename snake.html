        <section class="snakea"><h2>the corn snake</h2><p>Corn snakes (Pantherophis guttatus) are a species of non-venomous snake native to the southeastern United States, known for their calm nature and attractive coloration. They typically display orange or reddish scales with distinctive black-bordered blotches, resembling kernels of corn, which is how they got their name. Corn snakes are popular pets due to their manageable size, usually growing between 1.2 to 1.8 meters in length, and their relatively easy care requirements. They are excellent hunters in the wild, helping control rodent populations, and their friendly disposition makes them suitable for both beginner and experienced reptile keepers.</p></section>
        <section class="snakea"><h2 id="risk">the risks</h2><p>The risks associated with owning a corn snake are minimal compared to other snake species. They are not venomous and rarely bite, but if threatened, they might strike defensively. Any bites are usually superficial and not harmful. The primary concern with corn snakes as pets is their potential to escape if their enclosure is not secure, as they are excellent at finding small gaps or loose lids. If they escape, they can be hard to locate due to their slender bodies and ability to squeeze into tight spaces. Additionally, like all reptiles, corn snakes can carry salmonella bacteria, so proper hygiene—such as washing hands after handling the snake or cleaning its habitat—is essential to prevent illness. Overall, with the right care, corn snakes are low-risk, rewarding pets.</p></section>
        <section class="snakea"><h2 id="habitat">their habitat</h2><p>For a corn snake to thrive, its terrarium must be appropriately sized and maintained. Juvenile snakes can live in a terrarium of about 75 liters, but adult corn snakes require at least a 150-liter enclosure. The terrarium should be securely closed with a locking lid to prevent escapes. Temperature regulation is crucial, with one side of the tank kept between 29-32°C, while the cooler side should be around 24°C, allowing the snake to thermoregulate. Heating can be provided by an under-tank heater or heat lamp. Humidity levels should stay between 40-50%, achieved by occasional misting. The terrarium should also include hiding spots on both the warm and cool sides, a shallow water dish for drinking and soaking, and suitable substrate such as aspen shavings or paper towels. While UVB lighting is not essential, providing a natural light cycle can benefit the snake’s overall well-being.</p></section>
